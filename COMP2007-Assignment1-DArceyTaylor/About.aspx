            <p>
                I am currently enrolled in the Computer Programming program at Georgian College, where I have learned to
                    use many different coding languages such as HTML5, CSS, PHP, Java, Arduino and many others. In my spare
                    time I enjoy playing video games, guitar, spending time with my friends, and playing with my dogs. But
                    when it comes to my school work I am very passionate and take it very seriously.
